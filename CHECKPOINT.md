# CHECKPOINT — 2026-08-06, session close (stage-led image engine committed at `eb50e3a`, NOT pushed)

**For a cold terminal with no memory of the session that produced this.** Read this file, then
`docs/handovers/STATE.md`. Everything below was verified in-session, not recalled.

⚠️ **`docs/handovers/STATE.md` is dated 2026-07-28 and knows nothing about the last five sessions.**
It has been wrong more than once. **Trace code and query the DB; do not trust handover prose.**

## 1. Where the repo is

| | |
|---|---|
| Branch | `railway-build` |
| HEAD | **`eb50e3a`** — committed locally |
| origin/railway-build | **`e71f62f`** — UNMOVED |
| Unpushed | **1 commit** |
| Deployed? | **NO.** Railway has not seen this work. Push = instant deploy (~4s, no gate). |

**The next push needs a fresh explicit "push" from Arfeen.** No prior authorisation carries forward.

⚠️ **Correction to the old version of this file**, which claimed committing it "triggers a production
deploy". It does not — **pushing** deploys. This file is now committed deliberately, because a fresh
session reads it first and a stale one is a trap.

---

## 2. What `eb50e3a` actually changes

The awareness stage now drives the **shot concept** — subject, action, composition — and the sub-type
only **styles** it (lighting, backdrop, texture). Previously the style template fixed pose and
composition and the stage was appended afterwards, so it modified a decision already made.
`[AWARENESS-PLAYBOOK §3]` names that exact failure: *"If styling is allowed to lead, the ad risks
falling into 'default' poses… which trigger Entity ID clustering."*

Files: `routers/adCreatives.ts` · `_core/imageGeneration.ts` · `_core/compositeHeadline.ts` ·
`adCreativesGenerator.ts` · two test files · `scripts/measure-text-safe-zone.ts` · 3 research
reports + their README.

---

## 3. ✅ PROVEN — on live renders, zero DB writes, every run reconciled to 405

- **Layer 1 across all five awareness stages**, isolated: style and sub-type held constant, stage the
  only variable, with the styling half of every prompt asserted **byte-identical before any spend**.
  A same-prompt control render sets the diffusion-noise floor — noise changes *who and how*, the
  stage changes *what is happening*.
- **Fix 1 — Problem-Aware** carries friction in the **environment**, not the face. The first rebuild
  used "a hand at the temple", which the banked guardrails list verbatim as a prohibited distress
  trigger carrying *"a total retrieval penalty"*.
- **Fix 2 — Product-Aware** is an expert mid-demonstration addressing someone off-camera. It had been
  rendering as a head-on portrait, colliding with Most-Aware's PD-4 direct address. Guarded by test.
- **Fix 3 — verified ONLY on the composite.** Headline/body/CTA land on darkened defocused surface
  instead of across the work the scene was told to keep clear. ⚠️ **The raw render looked fine while
  the finished ad was broken — raw pixels cannot prove this.**
- **4:5 feed** with the reserved band keyed to **emitted pixels**, plus its guards (§4).
- **Still-life `screenshot` slot has pixels for the first time** — person-free, abstract text-free
  screen, clean plate held, and it stayed on gpt-image-1. **n=1.**

Proof images on disk (not committed — binary weight):
`docs/screenshots/run-2026-08-05-layer1-isolation/` · `run-2026-08-05-layer1-reprove/` ·
`run-2026-08-06-layer3-45/` · `run-2026-08-06-layer3-verify/`.
`run-2026-08-05-layer12-proof/` is the **pre-rebuild** "before" set.

## 4. The text-safe band — measured, per-canvas, and guarded

**Do not replace this with a constant.** It was measured by pushing a synthetic plate through the
real compositor at worst-case content (`scripts/measure-text-safe-zone.ts`).

| canvas | topmost glyph | reserved | wording |
|---|---|---|---|
| Flux 4:5 → **896×1088** | 0.6445 | 0.5048 | "the lower three-fifths" |
| gpt-image-1 4:5 → **1024×1280** | 0.6445 | 0.4955 | "the lower half" |
| 1:1 1024×1024 | 0.5693 | 0.5707 | "the lower three-fifths" |
| 9:16 1080×1920 | 0.5875 | 0.5515 | "the lower three-fifths" |

- **NOT ratio-invariant** — 4:5 and 9:16 are **5.7pp apart**. A scalar silently mis-reserves the
  9:16 path. Size-invariant *within* a ratio (1024×1280 vs 1440×1800 differ by 0.0001).
- `reservedFromBottom = 0.376 × W + padBottom(H)` — predicts 9:16 to within **two pixels**.
- **Keyed off EMITTED pixels, never the ratio string.** Flux answers "4:5" with **896×1088** (0.824);
  gpt-image-1 returns a true 1024×1280. Those straddle a band boundary, so the person slots were
  under-reserving by ~1pp — clearance by margin, not design. **Flux is deliberately NOT forced to
  exact 4:5**; 896×1088 is a valid Meta asset.
- **Crop direction settled on pixels**: `DEFAULT_CROP_DIRECTION = "bottom"` (keep the upper 1280).
  gpt-image-1 cannot emit 4:5, so it renders 1024×1536 and is cropped. The alternative was cramped
  and top-heavy. Both candidates are in `run-2026-08-06-layer3-45/08-crop-A` vs `08-crop-B`.
- `imageFormat` now records dimensions read off the rendered buffer, so a row cannot lie.

## 5. 🔴 OPEN — read this before claiming anything works

1. **THE WIRING GAP IS THE NEXT ROCK.** **Five of eight fan-out sites pass no stage** and render the
   pre-rebuild prompt. Only the cascade (`adCreativesGenerator.ts`) carries Layers 1–3.
   ⚠️ **Opening this forces the 4-vs-8 cardinality decision** — the tabloid deck is 4
   (`AD_VARIATIONS`), the concept batch is 8, and `adCreativesGenerator.ts:534` **throws** on a
   mismatch because a mismatch once caused a live outage (`5f3294d` → `304f6fd`). **Arfeen's call.**
2. **Esoteric and aspirational sub-types are unproven** with the new shot concepts. Only `grounded`
   has been rendered since the rebuild.
3. **flux@9:16 emission has never been measured.** It takes the conservative fallback.
   **Measure it before any stage-led vertical ships.**
4. **The editorial path has no Layers 1/2/3** and is untouched. A run routing editorial proves nothing.
5. **Four person stages (Unaware, Problem-Aware, Product-Aware, Most-Aware) were not re-rendered**
   after the band was rekeyed to emitted pixels. That change only **widened** clearance so it cannot
   have regressed them, but they are unswept — fold into the next full run.
6. **DEPLOY IS GATED on the shared paths.** `makeVertical` (9:16) and `regenerateSingle` share
   `generateAdImagePrompt` / `rendererForStyle` / `renderAdCreative`. **None of the five wizard
   procedures has an automated test** and they are historically error-prone (P6b). Exercise them
   before pushing.

## 6. ⚠️ EVERY GATE IS BLIND TO WHETHER A PICTURE IS GOOD

G4 checks only that a non-empty PNG reached disk. Nothing in the suite can see melodrama, legible
in-image text, an anatomical failure, or a subject buried under the headline.
**That judgement is Arfeen's and only Arfeen's. CC never self-certifies a visual result.**

---

## 7. Production data — verified this session

- `adCreatives` = **405** (the baseline). `meta_published_ads` = **2**.
- **Protected services untouched:** `272:5 273:5 275:5 276:5 277:5 285:4` — 29 creatives.
- **The 409-vs-405 drift is resolved.** It was NOT failed teardown: the previous proof's teardown was
  clean (0 surviving proof services, 0 orphan rows). Four rows (450–453, service 287, user 1) were a
  dummy demo campaign Arfeen made on 2026-08-05; he authorised their deletion and they are gone.
- ⚠️ **Service 287 still exists** and is NOT a shell — ~115 rows across 11 tables (60 hvcoTitles,
  14 placeholderValues, 11 heroMechanisms, 10 headlines, 9 adCopy, 6 campaignConcepts, plus ICP,
  offer, LP, email and WhatsApp). It now has **0 adCreatives** and is inert. Deleting the service row
  would cascade-delete the placeholderValues and orphan ~101 rows at `serviceId = NULL`. **Not done;
  needs its own decision.**

---

## 8. Gates

- `npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -c "error TS"` → **34** (CLAUDE.md §8 still says 35 — stale by one)
- **554 tests across 12 suites**, including the new `server/textSafeZoneCoupling.test.ts`
- ⚠️ `jobs` is **NOT a baseline metric** — 24h retention. Only `running = 0` has signal.

---

## 9. Traps specific to this work

- **The old test asserting the stage directive is APPENDED was DELETED.** It passed throughout while
  the stage never reached the picture — it was locking in the defect. Do not reinstate it.
- **`rendererForStyle` bounces unknown ratios to Flux.** Requesting a ratio gpt-image-1 cannot serve
  silently moves the still life off the model the bake-off chose (**6/6 vs 2/6** niche relevance).
- **The banked safe-zone figures describe META'S UI clearance**, not our own type. Never size our
  text band from them — measure it.
- **Research vs. code:** `[AWARENESS-PLAYBOOK §2]` asks for proof charts, calendars and labelled
  diagrams at various stages. **All are composed of text.** The object slot was retired over exactly
  this (48 renders, 2 leaked). Three departures are documented on `AWARENESS_DEPICTION`. PD-4 stands.
- **`[AWARENESS-PLAYBOOK §4]` contradicts its own §3** — its table makes Action a function of style.
  §3 + §2 govern.

---

## 10. Standing rules

- **⛔ NO PUSH WITHOUT ARFEEN'S EXPLICIT "push" IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING MESSAGE.**
- **Every prod write needs explicit "execute"/"go ahead" in the immediately preceding message.**
- **A LIVE RENDER IS THE ONLY PROOF OF A LIVE IMAGE PATH** — and for anything involving the text
  overlay, **the COMPOSITE is the only proof**. The raw render passed while the finished ad was broken.
- **Save proof images to disk BEFORE any teardown.** Teardown outranks the artifact read.
- **Do NOT write to protected services 272–277, or to service 285.**
- **⚠️ TEARDOWN IS ALWAYS ID-SCOPED, NEVER USER-SCOPED.** Smoke user **117174 OWNS the 25 protected
  creatives on services 272–277** (verified 2026-08-06). A teardown written as "delete this user's
  rows" would destroy them. Always `WHERE id IN (…)` plus a userId guard — never userId alone.
- **Write prose-heavy records with Write/Edit, never a bash heredoc** — backticks get shell-substituted.
- **⚠️ ONLY THE TABLOID DECK IS 4.** `EDITORIAL_VARIATIONS` stays 5.
- **~309 untracked earlier-session files deliberately left alone.** Never sweep them into a commit.
- **`railway run` block-buffers stdout.** Two runs today were invisible for 25 minutes while failing.
  Proof scripts log to a file with `appendFileSync` as well as stdout — keep that.
